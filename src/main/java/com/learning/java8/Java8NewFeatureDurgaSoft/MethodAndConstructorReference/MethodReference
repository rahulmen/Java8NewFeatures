1. Method Reference is the alternative for Lambda Expression.

2. If we want to implment abstract method defined in a functional interface one way is to write lambda Expression.
   And another way is to write a method with same arguments into a class and perform method calling using double
   semi-colon operator ::

   Syntax:-
   <InterfaceName> inter = <ClassName>::<method name>
   Interface interf = Test::m2;

   m2 is a static method.
