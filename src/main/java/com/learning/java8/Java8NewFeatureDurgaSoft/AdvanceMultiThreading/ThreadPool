ThreadPool :-

1.Creating a new thread for every job may create problem and memory problems to overcome this we should go for thread pool.
2 Thread Pool is a pool of already created thread ready to do our job.
3. Java 1.5V introduces thread pool framework to implement thread pools
4. Thread Pool frameWork also knows as Executor FrameWork.
5. We can create thread pool as follows
ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

6. We can submit a runnable Job by using submit() method
service.submit(job);

7. We can shut down executor Service by using shutDown method
service.shutdown();
