Supplier Function Interface is used when we want to get something.

interface Supplier{
R get<R>();
}

R :- Return type which we gonna get from Supplier.

Note :- Supplier and Consumer are opposite of each other just like consumer take input parameter and return Void.
Similarly supplier wont take any argument and return something.

Supplier Functional Interface Wont contain any default and static method.
